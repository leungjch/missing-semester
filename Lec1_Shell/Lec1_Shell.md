# Lecture 1: Shells
Shells are the primary way to interact with a computer. The most common shell isBash (Bourne Again Shell)

# Common Bash scripts
`date`	# Shows date

`echo [string]` # Echoes back a string

# Environment variables
The computer can recognize `date` and `echo` using "invariant environment variables". Examples of env vars are the location of home directory, $PATH variable

`echo $PATH` # Shows all of the paths that Bash will search
