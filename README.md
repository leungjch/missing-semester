# Missing Semester (notes and exercises)
These are my notes and selected exercises from the Missing Semester course that I followed along.

## Reflections
In August 2020, I finally made the switch to Linux. It took me several years to realize that some programming setup tasks are unnecessarily complicated to do on Windows, and I also realized that most of the programs I was running daily didn't require Windows (i.e. I don't game anymore and sparingly use Adobe products, etc.). When I was running a lengthy web scraper, I didn't want Windows auto-updating. When I was installing a tool or trying to fix a problem, I would sometimes see that the Linux method was simpler (sudo apt-get). In short, I felt like Windows was holding me back. Some people make a comparison about being able to finally "own" a computer with Linux, and how this is not the case for Windows. Even just a few days after installing Ubuntu, I can start to see how this is true.

Shortly after making the switch, I came across this course and started following along with it. I think this course was helpful in getting acquainted with Linux (even though it's intended for any OS), and has helped me become a more efficient programmer. Here are some of the things I learned:
- Using the terminal, navigating around with it, overall becoming more comfortable with command-line interfaces over GUIs
- Vim
- Bash scripting
- Regular expressions (regex)
